# credit-card-fraud-detection
This is a credit card fraud detection app using Python, Sckit-Learn and Machine Learning <br>

Main challenges involved in credit card fraud detection are: <br>

1. Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time. <br>
2. Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones
3. Data availability as the data is mostly private. <br>
4. Misclassified Data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported.<br>
5. Adaptive techniques used against the model by the scammers.<br>
